Welcome to roslyn-analyzers documentation
=================================================

The `roslyn-analyzers repository <https://github.com/edumserrano/roslyn-analyzers>`_ started as a learning experience about the Roslyn API. Hopefully it will grow to hold many more analyzers.

This documentation contains generic information regarding the Roslyn Platform that will help understand how the repository was created as well as convey the the information that is required to understand the code in the repository. In addition it contains a description of all the analyzers and code fixes present in the repository.

Read `this <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#in-restructuredtext>`_ to understand how this documentation was created and how you can build the `docs <https://github.com/edumserrano/roslyn-analyzers/tree/master/Docs>`_ for the roslyn-analyzers repository.
